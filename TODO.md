* File save and open dialogs
* Try integrating arbitrary applications by emulating Windows 98 on the webpage [with v86](https://github.com/copy/v86/blob/master/docs/api.md),
  with an X server installed in the VM, and acting as an X client externally??
  And integrating a virtual filesystem??
  That would be undoubtedly cool, but idk how hard it might be,
  and especially what data channels are available between the VM and the host.
