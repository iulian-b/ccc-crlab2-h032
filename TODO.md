* File save and open dialogs

* Try integrating arbitrary applications by emulating Windows 98 on the webpage [with v86](https://github.com/copy/v86/blob/master/docs/api.md),
with an X server installed in the VM, and acting as an X client externally??
And integrating a virtual filesystem??
That would be undoubtedly cool, but idk how hard it might be,
and especially what data channels are available between the VM and the host.
Partially [inspired by OS.js](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=c0safRR0ldM&index=16&list=PL74DE0E481419C259).
